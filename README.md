# dotfiles

List of my dotfiles and configurations.

[Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) is used to help with symlink management.

This repo is part of my [os](https://github.com/siriusnottin/os) project, which is a cli to help me, as the title says, manage my os. It is a work in progress and I will be adding more features as I go along.
